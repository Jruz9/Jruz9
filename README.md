# Hello, my name is Jose Cruz
I am a full-stack software engineer specializing in Java, JavaScript, and Spring Boot application development.  My experience also includes data science projects utilizing Python and R.  I am currently developing applications in Java and Python, and exploring Go and Rust for bot and smart contract development.

Currently I am seeking a software engineering role focused on Java development, though I am always eager to expand my skillset and embrace new technologies. I love making an impact and if you are intrested, please feel free to contact me to discuss potential opportunities.
